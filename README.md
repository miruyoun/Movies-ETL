# Movies-ETL

## Brief Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new movie data, performs transformations to clean the data, and loads the data into existing tables. The main steps of the ETL process are shown here, such as using Python to extract data from CSV files, transforming it into data frames, and then loading it into a relational database (PostgreSQL specifically for this project).

### Query results
In the end, there were 6,052 rows in the movies table and 26,024,289 rows in the ratings table.
